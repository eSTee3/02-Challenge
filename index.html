            <h2>Coding Bootcamp Pre-Work Solution</h2>
            <p>
                I present to you the initial website-based solution that I was required to complete as part of the pre-work module.  It outlines the initial code-based items I learned about and executed some basic activities with.

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

            <p>
                Inbound strategies for lead generation require less work for your business, bringing customers directly to your website.

                As the search ranking for your business increases, your advertising costs decrease, and you no longer need to advertise your page.

        <h2>This Very Site!</h2>
        <p>
            This site was created following 2 full weeks-worth of coding bootcamp.  Note the evolution of sites from the initial pre-work site, to this site.  Gradient background coloring, text blur and animated header are just a few of the features that I've built into this site.
